Solutions for the 2024 advent of code.


### Golang

At least for the first few days I am going to be writing the solutions in go. To initial the module I ran:
```zsh
go mod init github.com/simonwardjones/advent-of-code-2024
```

### Running the code

To run day 1 for example:
```zsh
go run cmd/day01/main.go
```

To run the tests for day 1:
```zsh
go test ./day01/
```



To build the code into the bin folder run:
```zsh
go build -o bin/day1 cmd/day1/main.go
```
```
